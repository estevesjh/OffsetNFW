# OffsetNFW

A module to compute off-centered NFW profiles. The off-centering can be a single value or a 'Raleyigh','Gamma' or 'Exponential' distribtuion. The computation is perfomed by approximation an effective radius for a given pair of $R,R_mis$.

This code is based on https://github.com/msimet/OffsetNFW/.
